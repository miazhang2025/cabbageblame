  "overview": "The CAVERN Toolkit is a collection of software tools, Unity packages, and supporting documents that enables students to create immersive XR experiences even with little to no prior XR background. The CAVERN is a low-cost multiplayer CAVE with a 270° curved screen, 3D stereoscopic projection and a 20-foot diameter play area located at Carnegie Mellon University. These unique qualities of the CAVERN allow for multiple guests to physically explore an XR world together.",

    "description": "CAVERN is a 270-degree projection-based stereoscopic platform with a 20-foot wide play area. It supports surround audio and is created with the intention of hosting multiplayer. Various input devices can be connected, and our toolkit is currently supporting motion tracking using Vive Trackers. The toolkit includes a new rendering solution that supports head-tracked stereoscopic rendering in all directions. A system was made to abstract away the previously tedious process for incorporating motion-tracking devices for interaction input and configuring spatial audio for immersive sound design. To increase accessibility for students and beginner developers, a simplified interface was implemented within the Unity 6 editor, enabling setup with a single click. Additionally, several sample projects were created to serve as inspirations and jumping off points. All of the above are bundled into modular packages hosted in the Unity Package Manager (UPM) and accompanied by extensive documentation and tutorials."

  "sampleScene": {
    "title": "Sample Scene",
    "description": "Within the toolkit, we designed and built a beautiful botanical garden sample scene including basic setup to art assets, as well as basic interaction scripts, and a demo interaction system that can demonstrate the new features. We want to make sure all the visual and audio assets and the interaction scripts are there for you to use and build upon. The sample scene demonstrate an immersive experience of a little creature to find its mum in a dreamy surreal garden with giant flowers.",
